- The document involves the use of various libraries and tools such as numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, torchtext, torch, and nltk for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- Preprocessing steps include cleaning text data, lemmatization, and stop words removal using functions like cleaning(), beauty_df(), split_df(), and df_to_dict_unique().
- The document also involves the use of different models such as KNN, CNN, and LR with different vectorization techniques like CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and FastText for text classification tasks.
- Evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, F1 score, and accuracy score are used to assess the performance of the models on both training and test data.
- The document also includes the calculation of model metrics and the testing of various models with different vectorization techniques and preprocessing methods.
